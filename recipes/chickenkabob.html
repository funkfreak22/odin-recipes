        <h3>This is a chicken kabob recipe that I would love to share! Plan to marinate for 3 hours. Serve with Greek rice!</h3>
        
        <p>Perfect summertime dinner. Wow the yogurt marinade made the chicken delicious! People were raving at my outdoor evening Mediterrean mean. 
            I served with warm pita and hummus so folks could put their kabob items right into a pita to make a gyro. Also served a cold orzo pasta made with mint and feta. 
            This has become my go-to for a winning summer meal!</p>
